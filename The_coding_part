#So the code is about getting an input and placing It somewhere random inside the list. It was working fine until I entered so many inputs.  
import random
mylist = ["bıdıbıdı", "blabla", "cicibici"]
count = 2
while random.random() < 0.9:
    a = [input("please enter smth: ")]
    count += 1 
    x = random.randrange(0,count)
    mylist[x:x] = a
    
print(mylist)
